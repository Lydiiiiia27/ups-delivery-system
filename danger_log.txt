1. If one or more servers cooperating with our program have a problem and stop, or a problem exists with the connection to other servers, the program won't be able to provide services. In a worse case, it may have some exceptions and even crash.
2. When Amazon or the World Server sends a message with incorrect information, like the wrong package ID or the wrong truck ID, issues might occur. If some parts of the code don't provide a complete state check for the packages or the trucks, the program might not be able to notice that the current state is invalid for the state transition, which may cause some behavior errors.
3. If the Ups server exits due to errors, the data in memory may be lost. For the message tracking system, if we store messages with information including ack status only in memory, the system may lose track of the messages in case the program crashes. So, this could be dangerous, and it doesn't meet the requirements of a stateless program.
